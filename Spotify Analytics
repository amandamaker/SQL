# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.
# Finally, I performed the following analytics on the data using SQL.

/*What is the average danceability by artist and track?*/
SELECT artist_name, track_name, AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

/*Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?*/
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

/*What artist released the longest song?*/
SELECT artist_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC 
LIMIT 1;

/*What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?*/
SELECT AVG(danceability) AS avg_danceability, artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

/*What is the danceabilty, energy, and tempo of the least popular song?*/
SELECT artist_name, track_name, danceability, energy, tempo, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity ASC
LIMIT 1;

/*What is the average loudness of the top 5 most popular songs?*/
SELECT AVG(loudness) AS avg_loudness, artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 5;

/*What are the 5 most popular tracks that have an energy greater than 0.5?*/
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE energy > 0.5
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 5;
